Review the Furnace class. There are a lot of static things in this class.
Question: Identify all of the static things, and the reason why each is static.
Problem 3:
In your HVAC program, create a new class called WaterHeater. 
This represents a service call for a water heater. 
A water heater service call needs an address, date service requested, 
description of the problem, and the age of the water heater. 
Resolved service calls also need the resolved date, 
description of the resolution, and the fee charged to the customer.
The city requires that all service calls to water heaters 
have a mandatory $20 extra charge added. As this applies to 
all water heaters, add a static variable to your class to store this data.
Add a toString method to WaterHeater which returns a string 
containing all the static and instance variables for a WaterHeater. 
You should break down the fee into the service charge plus the $20 mandatory city fee.
Add code to HVAC.java to test your new class. 
Make sure you can add service calls for water heaters to the list of todayServiceCalls.*/
